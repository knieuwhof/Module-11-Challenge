# Module-11-Challenge

Please find the code and answers to this week's module challenge in the Module_11_Challenge.ipynb file. The instructions of the assignment are under the forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb - I was under the impression the entirity of the assignment was to be completed in Google colab, which is why my answers are located in a seperate notebook.

Please find detailed analysis including visualizations and comprehensive written answers to the required questions within the Module_11_Challenge.ipynb notebook. The optional part 5 section of the assignment has not yet been completed secondary to time constraints and that it is deemed optional. This part of the assignment will be uploaded at a later date.
